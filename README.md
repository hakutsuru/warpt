# WARPT
### Wrong Approach Ruby Parsing Test

I was excited to get a code test from an agile coaching business. I did not have much Ruby experience, but I have many years experience writing parsing code, and so... The code test was like a homework assignment -- it was to parse three files featuring different formats and delimiters, sort the aggregate results three ways, and export the sorted rows in a single file.

I could not bring myself to do it -- write a parser that did not check the data rows for the export delimiter, and such. So I coded something closer to what might be used in reality.

Honestly, I am still not sure how this would be unit tested, and it will be a while before I write fluent *idiomatic* Ruby. For example, this

    if !$test_mode then
      warpt_run()
    end

should probably have been *this*.

    if $0 == __FILE__
      warpt_run()
    end

Despite writing high level tests, and solving many problems not posed in the original test -- the response was rather harsh. I can understand it somewhat, considering how I would feel if expecting a simpleton hack, and getting 500 lines of code.

But it reminds me of how a professor chided me, when I was caught smirking at his momentary lapse... *You're not that good.*

I have coaching and teaching experience, so I was really excited by the opportunity. This kind of response though, makes me wonder if I am too dimwitted to be employable in this arid terrain of TDD-Agile gurus and zealots.

On my pile is "Refactoring in Ruby", and I am sure it will help me become a better Rubyist. But this parser seems lucid and easy to maintain, and I included plenty of *why* in comments.

Please do not troll, but drop me a line if there is anything particularly egregious about how I wrote this program. I would love to learn from similar projects that are deemed well-done. I learned Ruby primarily from Black "The Well-Grounded Rubyist", and I am working through "Agile Web Development with Rails". I have also read Dix "Service-Oriented Design with Ruby and Rails".

The code has been slightly modified to export three files instead of a single composite file. Essentially, this is the code that elicited the following feedback...

### Warpt Feedback

    - The solution creates intermediate files, has huge methods, terrible tests, unreadable code.
    - Puts tons of method definitions in a before filter in the tests. Â Very odd.
    - Redirects standard out to clean up test output
    - Tests contain a ton of duplication
    - Each method is very noisy and hard to read
    - Tests parse for Stack Traces being output to the redirected stdout.
